# ðŸ“œ CampusCoin Smart Contract

CampusCoin (`CC`) is an ERC20-compatible token used within a university ecosystem. It allows:

- The **university** to manage tokens and collect service fees.
- **Students** to earn, spend, and get rewarded through a tier system.
- **Service providers** to offer services and receive payments in tokens.

## Smart Contract Roles and Responsibilities

The Smart Contract foresees the following roles:

### 1. **Admin** 
The contract deployer and university representative.
- Add/remove students and service providers.
- Mint CampusCoin tokens.
- Set platform fee percentage.
- Execute tier-based airdrops.

### 2. **University** 
It collects service fees.
-Receives a portion of each service payment as a platform fee.

### 3. **Students** 
Registered users who can spend CampusCoins and receive rewards.
- Spend tokens to pay for services.
- Receive airdrops based on spending tier.
- Rate service providers.
- Get automatically upgraded to higher tiers:
- Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold (based on total spending).

### 4. **Service Providers** 
Registered entities offering services within the ecosystem.
- Add, update, and deactivate services.
- Set service discounts.
- Receive payments in tokens.
- Receive ratings from students.

## Project Structure
This project follows a standard HardHat layout with additional integration for SuMo (a smart contract mutation testing tool).

## Prerequisites
Before interacting with this project, ensure you have the following installed:

* Node.js
* npm (comes with Node.js)

Then, install the project dependencies with `npm install`.

## Useful Commands

### HardHat (Testing Framework)
HardHat is used to compile, test, and interact with the smart contract.

* Compilng the Smart Contract: `npx hardhat compile`
* Running the tests on the Smart Contract: `npx hardhat test`


### SuMo (Mutation Testing Tool)
SuMo is used to assess the effectiveness of your tests by introducing controlled mutations in your smart contract code.
* Generating the mutants: `npx sumo lookup`
* Running the tests on all mutants: `npx sumo test`
* Running the tests on a specific mutant: `npx sumo test <mutantID>`
